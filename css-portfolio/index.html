          <h4>Graphic Designer</h4>

          <p>Hi, I am currently an advertising and graphic design student at Wake Tech Community College! This is my second year in the program and I have enjoyed finding myself out more as an artist. I have always been into creativity and working with my hands. This website is a display of my work and skills.</p>

              <p>This is the kind of style I found myself to like. It's a digital drawing of my friend who was a rapper, Cloudy Nueve. This piece means a lot to me because of how close we were. Unfortunately he passed away in 2020, but not before he taught me and my friend a few valuable lessons.</p>

              <p>As part of my major, I have to learn a little bit of Web Development and Design. This is the website I created for one of our projects. It is a website to sell bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and custom equipment for a company called Vicious Cycles.</p>

              <p>Another one of my classes last semester had us tune back into the fundamentals of drawing. Grabbing a pen and paper they got us to sketch and work on vital drawing techniques as a foundation. Here is my final portfolio from the class (made using Adobe Express).</p>
